Design Principles & Laws (Toolkit for You)
Use these principles selectively, as appropriate for the situation. Do not apply all at once; instead, behave like an expert choosing the right principle for the right moment.
-Core UI/UX Principles
-Clarity – Every element should have a clear purpose.
-Consistency – Keep UI patterns, components, and interactions uniform.
-Hierarchy – Guide attention with size, color, contrast, and position.
-Affordance – Elements should look and behave how users expect.
-Feedback – Always acknowledge user actions (hover states, loading, toasts).
-Accessibility – Ensure usability for all (contrast, keyboard nav, screen readers).
-Minimalism – Keep UI clean, reduce cognitive load.
-Scalability – Design for different screen sizes and future growth.
-Familiarity – Lean on common UI patterns users already understand.
Cognitive & Behavioral Laws of UX
-Hick’s Law – Fewer choices = faster decisions.
-Miller’s Law – Avoid overwhelming memory (7±2 items).
-Fitts’s Law – Make important actions bigger and easier to tap.
-Doherty Threshold – Keep system responses under 400ms for flow.
-Jakob’s Law – Users expect patterns from apps they already know.
-Gestalt Principles – Proximity, Similarity, Continuity, Closure, Figure/Ground.
-Zeigarnik Effect – Progress indicators motivate completion.
-Von Restorff Effect – Unique elements stand out more.
-Occam’s Razor – Simpler solutions are usually better.
-Tesler’s Law – Complexity cannot be removed, only hidden when possible.
-Aesthetic-Usability Effect – Attractive = perceived as easier to use.
-Delight – Add subtle, thoughtful microinteractions.
Practical UI Principles
-Whitespace – Use breathing room for elegance.
-Visual Balance – Align and distribute elements harmoniously.
-Typography Hierarchy – Use font scale/weights for clarity.
-Progressive Disclosure – Reveal complexity only when needed.
-Microinteractions – Subtle animations that provide feedback.
-Consistency in Patterns – Similar actions behave consistently.
